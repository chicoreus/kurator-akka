Kurator-Akka Framework
======================

The [kurator-akka](https://github.com/kurator-org/kurator-akka) repository hosts source code and examples for the **Kurator-Akka** scientific workflow framework.  This software toolkit is being developed as part of the [Kurator project](http://wiki.datakurator.net/web/Kurator) and is designed to make it easy to develop and run high-performance data cleaning workflows.


**Kurator-Akka** is based on the [Akka actor toolkit and runtime](http://akka.io).  It aims to accelerate development of new data cleaning actors and to facilitate development of new workflows assembled from these actors.  **Kurator-Akka** supports actors implemented either in Java or Python, and the framework shields actor developers from the complexities of using the Akka API directly.  Workflows are specified using a YAML-based language that defines how data flows between the actors at run time.

Example actor and workflow
--------------------------

A *workflow* is a collection of actors configured to carry out some set of tasks.  An *actor* is a software component that receives data either from outside the workflow, or from other actors within the same workflow that it is configured to listen to. Actors in **Kurator-Akka** may be defined either in Java or Python. Actors in a **Kurator-Akka** workflow run concurrently (in different threads).

##### Java implementation of a Multiplier actor

The Java class below defines a simple actor type for multiplying an integer by a configurable constant:

    import org.kurator.akka.AkkaActor;
    public class Multiplier extends AkkaActor {
        public double factor = 1;
        
        @Override public void onData(Object i) {
        	broadcast((double)i * factor);
        }
    }

As shown above, a new Java actor type can be implemented by declaring a new Java class that overrides the `onData()` method of the `org.kurator.akka.AkkaActor` class.  This method will be called by the **Kurator-Akka** framework each an actor of this type receives any data.  The `broadcast()` method is used within the `onData()` method to send data (usually the results of performing some computation on the data received by the actor) to any other actors in the workflow configured to listen to this one.

##### Python implementation of the Multiplier actor

An implementation of the same actor type in Python does not require a class to be defined:

    factor = 1
    def multiply(i):
        return factor * i

The **Kurator-Akka** framework calls the `multiply()` method on each data item received by this actor.  The value returned from the function is automatically broadcast to listeners.

##### YAML declaration of the Python version of the Multiplier actor

In addition to the Java or Python definition of an actor, an *actor type* declaration authored in YAML is needed to make the actor available for use in workflows.  The following declares that actors of type `Multiplier`, a subtype of actor type `PythonFunctionActor`, invoke the `multiply()` function defined in the file `multiplier.py`:

    types:

    - id: Multiplier
      type: PythonActor
      properties:
        script: multiplier.py
        onData: multiply

##### Defining a workflow that uses the Multiplier actor

With the above YAML saved to a file named `actors.yaml`, a `Multiplier` actor can be used in a workflow also defined in YAML. The workflow below accepts an input value from the user, multiplies it by 3, and outputs the result:

    imports:

    - file:actors.yaml

    components:

    - id: MultiplyByThreeWorkflow
      type: Workflow
      properties:
        actors:
          - !ref ReadOneNumber
          - !ref MultiplyByThree
          - !ref PrintProduct

    - id: ReadOneNumber
      type: NumReader

    - id: MultiplyByThree
      type: Multiplier
      properties:
        listensTo:
          - !ref ReadOneNumber
        parameters:
          factor: 3

    - id: PrintProduct
      type: NumPrinter
      properties:
        listensTo:
          - !ref MultiplyByThree

The above declaration states the following: `MultiplyByThreeWorkflow` is a workflow comprising three actors, `ReadOneNumber`, `MultiplyByThree`, and `PrintProduct`. `MultiplyByThree` listens to (receives its input from) `ReadOneNumber`, and `PrintProducts` receives its input in turn from `MultiplyByThree`.  `MultiplyByThree` is declared to be an instance of the `Multiplier` actor type defined previously; this instance of `Multiplier` is configured to multiply each value it receives by a factor of 3.  The YAML declarations for the underlying actor types `NumReader`, `Multiplier`, and `NumPrinter` are all imported from `actors.yaml`.

The YAML definition of a workflow using Java implementations of each actor looks identical to a workflow using Python actors.  Java and Python actors can be used together in the same workflow.

##### Inlining Python actors

**Kurator-Akka** allows the code for Python actors to be provided *inline*, i.e. within the workflow definition itself. No additional Python script file to actor type declaration is needed in this case (the type of the actor is simply `PythonFunctionActor`).  For example, the block of YAML defining the `MultiplyByThree` actor in the workflow definition above depends on an additional YAML declaration for the `Multiplier` actor defined in the `actors.yaml` file, which in turn depends on a Python script file named `multiplier.py`.  Because the code for this actor is only a few lines long, it may be reasonable to define the actor entirely inline.  In other words, thus block of YAML in the workflow:

    - id: MultiplyByThree
      type: Multiplier
      properties:
        listensTo:
          - !ref ReadOneNumber
        parameters:
          factor: 3

can be replaced with:

    - id: MultiplyByThree
      type: PythonFunctionActor
      properties:
        listensTo:
          - !ref ReadOneNumber
        onData: triple
        code: |
          def triple(n):
            return 3 * n

The Python code defining the `multiply()` function is now defined within the same YAML file that declares the workflow as a whole. Inlined Python actors are useful for implementing simple actors needed for specific workflows.


Setting up Kurator-Akka
-----------------------

The following describes how to set up an environment for writing your own actors and workflows, and executing them using **Kurator-Akka**.

#### 1. Check installed version of Java
Kurator-Akka requires Java version 1.7 or higher. To determine the version of java installed on your computer use the `-version` option to the `java` command. For example,

    $ java -version
    java version "1.7.0_71"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_71-b14)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.71-b01, mixed mode)
    $

Instructions for installing Java may be found at [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/).  If you plan to develop new actors in Java (not just in Python) be sure to install the JDK.  Otherwise a JRE is sufficient.

#### 2. Download the Kurator-Akka jar

Kurator-Akka is distributed as a jar (Java archive) file that can be executed using the `java -jar` command. To download the most recent build of the latest **Kurator-Akka** code, navigate to the [Latest Successful Build](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/bamboo/browse/KURATOR-AKKA/latestSuccessful), click on the *Artifacts* tab, and download the *executable jar* artifact for the *kurator-akka* job.  The downloaded file will be named `kurator-akka-0.3-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.

Note that while released distributions of **Kurator-Akka** are available for download from the [Kurator Software Releases](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/confluence/display/KURATOR/Software+Releases) page, the remainder of this README pertains to the latest development version available in the GitHub repository.

#### 3. Install Kurator-Akka on your system

Once you have downloaded the **Kurator-Akka** jar, save the file in a convenient location and rename it to something like `kurator-akka.jar`.   **Kurator-Akka** can now be run using the `java -jar` command. The jar file includes several sample workflow scripts which can be accessed from the command line.

Test your installation by running the `hello.yaml` workflow. Assuming `kurator-akka.jar` is in your current working directory type:

    java -jar kurator-akka.jar -f classpath:/org/kurator/akka/samples/hello.yaml

If the Kurator-Akka jar is stored elsewhere, qualify `kurator-akka.jar` with the path to that file. For example, if you stored the jar file in the bin subdirectory of your home directory, running Kurator-Akka would look something like this on Linux or OS X:

    $ java -jar ~/bin/kurator-akka.jar -f classpath:/org/kurator/akka/samples/hello.yaml
    Hello World!
    $

On Windows platforms the command is similar:

    $ java -jar %USERPROFILE%\bin\kurator-akka.jar -f classpath:/org/kurator/akka/samples/hello.yaml
    Hello World!
    $

#### 4. Define a short command for running Kurator-Akka at the prompt

If you are running **Kurator-Akka** on an Apple OSX or Linux system (or use Git Bash or Cygwin on Windows), you may define an *alias* to simplify running YesWorkflow at the command line. On Windows platforms you similarly may define a *doskey macro* for running **Kurator-Akka** at the prompt.

For example, if you have saved `yesworkflow-0.3-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` to the bin subdirectory of your home directory, the following command will create a `bash` alias for running **Kurator-Akka** simply by typing `ka`:

    alias ka='java -jar ~/bin/kurator-akka.jar'

If you use `csh` or `tcsh` the command is:

    alias kurator-akka java -jar ~/bin/kurator-akka.jar

On Windows the command to create the `ka` doskey macro is:

     doskey ka=java -jar %USERPROFILE%\bin\kurator-akka.jar $*

On all platforms the `hello.yaml` demo now can be run using the short command:

    $ ka -f classpath:/org/kurator/akka/samples/hello.yaml
    Hello World!
    $


#### 5. Extract the samples (optional)

If you would like to browse and edit the sample workflows included in the **Kurator-Akka** jar, type the following (qualifying the path to the Kurator-Akka jar as necessary) from the directory containing the jar file and extract its contents to your filesystem:

    jar xf kurator-akka.jar org/kurator/akka/samples

To run a script residing on the filesystem, you can use the file scheme:

    $ ka -f file:org/kurator/akka/samples/hello.yaml
    Hello World!

The `file:` qualifier is optional, however. By default **Kurator-Akka** looks for workflows on your filesystem. So this will work, too:


    $ ka -f org/kurator/akka/samples/hello.yaml
    Hello World!

Note that the path to `hello.yaml` above is relative (it does not start with a `/`).
